<p>At a young age, I found that I was always wondering about how things worked. The challenge of assembling furniture 
    without even the smallest glance at the instructions was something that excited me. It's no wonder that my initial major
    in college was mechanical engineering. Although my journey took me down a path in business marketing/pr and aviation, my curiosity 
    never weaned.

<p>
    My curiosity has taken me on a path of continual learning to explore new skills. With that and my passion to create 
    and contribute to the creation of things, the world of development seemed like an obvious next step. I was weary at first, 
    with tech being such a male dominanted field, but after spending time learning Ruby, my first coding language, I felt 
    like I had found my calling.

<p class="mb-5">I hope to get to a point where I can become a mentor to young women of color and show that
    they too can enter and flourish in the world of tech.
