<p>
    At a young age, I found that I was always wondering about how things worked. The challenge of assembling furniture 
    without even the smallest glance at the instructions was something that excited me. It's no wonder that my initial major
    in college was mechanical engineering. Although my journey veered me to marketing/pr and aviation, my curiosity 
    never weaned.

<p>
   My inquisitive nature has taken me on a path of continual learning to explore new cultures and skills. Through my 6+ years in the aviation
   industry, I was able to satiate my need to explore cultures foreign to my own around the world. I am now looking to explore my passion to create
   and contribute to the creation of things through the world of development. I was weary at first, with tech being such a male dominated field,
   but after spending time learning my first coding language, Ruby, I felt that I had found my calling. Finding the greatest satisfaction from solving
   technical problems that arise in projects or code challenges.

    My ultimate goal is to be in a position to give back by becoming a mentor to young women of color in order to show them that
    they too can break through and flourish in the world of tech.
